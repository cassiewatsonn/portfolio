# Portfolio

## Description

Personal Portfolio Page for Cassandra Watson. This project is built to show Cassandra's skills, experience, accomplishments and attribute to users. The users of this page will be prospect employers. The main goal is to highlight Cassandra's best work.

As an employer, they look for various work samples when searching candidates to fill positions. Cassandra's page will allow employers to review samples of her work and assess whether she is a good candidate for an open position.

## Usage
To use this Horizon Page, you can review each tab that will bring you to more information. For example: if you select "Work" on the top of the page, it will direct you to the section of Cassandra's work. You will also find information like contact information, about me, pictures, etc. You will also notice that most of the critical requirements necessary for the hiring process are shown. 

When I load the portfolio, then I am presented with Cassandra's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about her, her work, and how to contact her. When I click one of the links in the navigation, then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section. When I click on the link to the section about her work, then the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of Cassandra's applications. When I am presented with her first application, then that application's image should be larger in size than the others.When I click on the images of the applications, then I am taken to that deployed application. When I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, then I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
